Certificate & Badge Issuer (MVP Blueprint)
✅ Core Problem It Solves

Trainers, schools, and course creators waste time manually creating certificates.

Many certificates are easily faked (no verification).

Existing tools are bloated or charge too much.

🎯 Solution

A lean SaaS that lets anyone:

Create branded certificate/badge templates.

Upload recipient list (CSV or manual entry).

Auto-generate certificates as PDFs.

Host each certificate at a unique verification link.

Deliver certificates via email/download in bulk.

🔑 Key Features (MVP)

Auth & Dashboard

Sign up / log in (email & password).

Simple dashboard: create template, issue certificates, track usage.

Template Builder

Upload logo, set colors, fonts.

Add placeholders: [Name], [Course Title], [Date], [Issuer Signature].

Save template for re-use.

Certificate Generation

Upload CSV with names & details.

Preview before generating.

Flask generates PDF certificates (reportlab or weasyprint).

Verification System

Each certificate = unique link (/verify/:uuid).

Public page shows certificate preview + “valid” stamp.

Delivery

Bulk download as ZIP.

Email to recipients (via Mailgun/SendGrid).

Billing

Free plan: 10 certs/month (watermark).
